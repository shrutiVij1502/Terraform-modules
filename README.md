# Terraform Infra launch using the modules 

## Step 1 
create a seprate directory , and create a main.tf file , in which we are going to create every resourse using the refrence of the modules that we will create in different files 

## Step 2
Create a folder named as modules and then create seperate folders for the resources in the working directory 

in each file , we can mention the variables or we can create the variable.tf file in each single resource directory 

Here, we created 

one directory named as EC2 and created the ec2 module and variable in the same file
